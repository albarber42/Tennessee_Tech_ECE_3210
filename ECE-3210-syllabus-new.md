##  Course description
    Modern and classical methods of control system analysis of continuous-time systems. Introduction to design tools.

##  Prerequisites
    PHYS 2110 and C or better in either ECE 3010 or ME 2330.

##  Major Teaching Method
    Flipped classroom- online lectures/video with in-class problem solving.

##  Course instructional outcomes
    - Model dynamical systems using transfer function and state space representation.
    - Analyze the stability of linear invariant systems using Routh-Hurwitz stability.
    - Identify the parameters that characterize the  transient and steady-state performance of LTI systems.
    - Determine analytically the performance parameters for prototype second order systems.

##  Course topics

    1.  Mathematical background: Laplace transform and applications (5%)
    2.  Transfer functions and signal-glow graphs: impulse response,
    transfer function, block diagram, signal flow graph (5%)
    3.  Frequency domain modeling of physical systems-Transfer Function:
    electric networks, mechanical systems, systems with delays (30%)
    4.  Time domain modeling of physical systems-State Space Model: State
    variable state variable, state equation, output equation,
    transition matrix, characteristic equation (10%)
    5.  Stability of linear systems: BIBO stability, Routh-Hurwitz stability
    (10%)
    6.  Time Domain analysis of linear systems (15%)
    7.  Root-locus technique (15%)
    8.  Tests (10%)

## Grading and evaluation procedures
    There will be two tests and a final exam graded on a straight scale ($\geq 90 = A$,$\geq 80 = B$, $\geq 70 = C$, $\geq 60 = D$, $< 59 = F$). The final exam will count for two test grades. The lowest exam grade of the four will be dropped. Solutions will be discussed during the lecture following the exam if time permits. All grading discrepancies must be brought up in writing no later than one week after the exam is returned. A simple note describing your contentions will do.

    External homework will be minimal, but worth 10% (1 letter grade)

#### Professionalism
    Professionalism is a measure of your behavior regarding expected practice as an engineer. This includes aspects such as attendance, note taking, consistency of performance, tenacity in problem solution, leadership, legibility and organization of problem solutions, clarity of communication, etc. For details on expected behavior, please consult *The Unwritten Rules of Engineering* by W.J. King, with revision by J.G. Skakoon. For your own professional development, I highly recommend that you [own a personal copy](https://www.amazon.com/Unwritten-Laws-Engineering-James-Skakoon-dp-0791861961/dp/0791861961/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=). If you read an older edition of the book (prior to Skakoon), please be attentive to the fact that some of the comments, especially those regarding polishing shoes, are considered rather quaint today. Two points will be automatically be deducted from your professionalism score each time you receive less than a 70% on an exam *and* do not see me personally within one week after receiving the exam grade to clear up confusion.

##  Attendance
    Attendance is not required but for examinations. Given the style of the class, all lectures will be received from "home" with in-class work focusing on practicing skills learned online.
    Given the current situation with COVID-19, only half of the class will be allowed in the classroom at any time. You will be assigned to a cohort; Tuesday or Thursday. We will certainly have to be flexible as the semester progresses.

##  Disability Accommodation
    Students with a disability requiring accommodations should contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS). An Accommodation Request (AR) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably by the end of the first week of the course. The ODS is located in the Roaden University Center, Room 112; phone 372-6119.
