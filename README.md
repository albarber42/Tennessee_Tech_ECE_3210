Please select the syllabus above to see it rendered to html.

To view the notes properly, you need to either have a sufficient python installation and use Jupyter, or click on one of the links below. 

[Run the notebooks online! Jupyter style:](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/josephcslater/Tennessee_Tech_ECE_3210/master) (classic- includes video telecon)

[All new faster launching](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/josephcslater/controls_binder/master?urlpath=git-pull?repo=<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/josephcslater/Tennessee_Tech_ECE_3210/master>) (still testing)

[Run the notebooks online! Jupyter Lab style:](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/josephcslater/Tennessee_Tech_ECE_3210/master?urlpath=lab) (more full-featured editors)  
Note: interactive widgets don't work well for me in this yet. 

Individual notebooks (files with the extention ``ipynb``) can be run *within* the virtual machine created with one of the two links in the sentences right above this. 

**If you click on the names outside of the virtual machine, you can't run any of the demos, you can just read them!!!**

If you wish to learn how to install Scientific Python on your own computer, please see my [introductory class readme](https://github.com/josephcslater/Introduction_to_Python/blob/master/README.rst). 

If you wish ti *edit* these notes and send me corrections (you would learn a lot doing this), you need to **fork** the repository, and clone from your own account. You can then edit on your computer, commite the back to your repository then submit a pull request in your repository. I'll review and approve or deny your changes. Good practice is to just try with a single typo correction (it can't ba hard to find them!).
